Badge Magic is an Android app to control LED name badges. The goal is to provide options to portray names, graphics and simple animations on LED badges. For the data transfer from the smartphone to the LED badge we use Bluetooth. The project is based on the work of [Gautier MECHLING](https://github.com/Nilhcem).

An introductory blog post of the project [is here](http://nilhcem.com/iot/reverse-engineering-bluetooth-led-name-badge).
